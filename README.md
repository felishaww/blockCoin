BlockCoin is a browser extension designed to prevent cryptocurrency miners from operating within web browsers. The purpose of developing this extension is to facilitate our thesis research, which involves the analysis of cryptojacking activities.


# How does it work?
The extension uses two methods to stop miners from working. First, it blocks requests that are loaded from a predefined blacklist, which is a common technique used by ad-blockers and mining blockers. The second method involves detecting possible mining activities using behavior analysis, where we monitor CPU usage and detect malicious mining activity within loaded scripts and quickly stopping them.
